# PDF Parser Automation

## Project Overview
This project automates the process of downloading, parsing, and staging PDF files based on date changes and configuration settings. It identifies which files need to be processed, downloads them, parses their contents, loads the results into a database, and manages file archiving. The workflow is controlled by command-line arguments and configuration files, with logging at each step for traceability. The main technologies used are Python and SQL.
